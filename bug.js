This bug occurs when using Expo's `Linking` API to handle deep links.  The `Linking.addEventListener` is not consistently triggering the callback function when a deep link is opened, especially in the background or after the app has been closed and reopened.  This results in the app not being able to handle the deep link properly. 

```javascript
import * as Linking from 'expo-linking';

Linking.addEventListener('url', (url) => {
  console.log('Deep link received:', url);
  // Handle deep link here
});
```
